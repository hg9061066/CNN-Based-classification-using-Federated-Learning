FedL-with-CNN: Federated Learning for Plant Disease Detection This repository contains a federated learning system for image-based plant disease detection. It uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with PyTorch and the Flower (FLWR) framework to train across multiple clients while preserving data privacy.
